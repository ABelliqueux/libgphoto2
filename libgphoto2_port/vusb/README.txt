This is a virtual PTP camera embedded in a USB port driver.

It is meant for libgphoto2 test purposes.

If you are seeing this file on a regular system, you likely
did not build any other USB driver.

In that case you should probably install libusb development headers
and libraries and recompile.

If you want to use it, copy JPG and other files into the directory
of this README (standard location is: /usr/share/libgphoto2_port/<version>/ )
